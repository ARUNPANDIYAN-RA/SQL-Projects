## Project Overview üéØ

	This ‚ÄòMedical Data History‚Äô project discusses about history of patients, doctors and their diagnosis in the provinces of Canada. With all the data‚Äôs regarding patients and doctors we need to explore relevant queries so that we can find some valuable insights based on their history. SQL is used in this project for all the ‚Äòdata interpretations and findings. 
	In this project ‚ÄòMedical Data History‚Äô  there‚Äôs a database provided called project_medical_data_history which consists of certain tables like  admissions, doctors, patients and province_names.


‚Ä¢	The admissions table consists data‚Äôs like
###	patient_id, admission_date, discharge_date, diagnosis, attending_doctor_id

‚Ä¢	The doctors table consists data‚Äôs like
###	doctor_id, first_name, last_name, speciality

‚Ä¢	 The patients table consists data‚Äôs like
###	patient_id,	first_name, last_name, gender, birth_date, city, province_id, allergies, height, weight

‚Ä¢	The province_names table consists data‚Äôs like
### province_id, province_name

With all the data‚Äôs in the tables admissions, doctors, patients, province_names we need to interpret and find the answers for the queries.
