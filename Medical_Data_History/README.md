## Project Overview 🎯

	This ‘Medical Data History’ project discusses about history of patients, doctors and their diagnosis in the provinces of Canada. With all the data’s regarding patients and doctors we need to explore relevant queries so that we can find some valuable insights based on their history. SQL is used in this project for all the ‘data interpretations and findings. 
	In this project ‘Medical Data History’  there’s a database provided called project_medical_data_history which consists of certain tables like  admissions, doctors, patients and province_names.


•	The admissions table consists data’s like
###	patient_id, admission_date, discharge_date, diagnosis, attending_doctor_id

•	The doctors table consists data’s like
###	doctor_id, first_name, last_name, speciality

•	 The patients table consists data’s like
###	patient_id,	first_name, last_name, gender, birth_date, city, province_id, allergies, height, weight

•	The province_names table consists data’s like
### province_id, province_name

With all the data’s in the tables admissions, doctors, patients, province_names we need to interpret and find the answers for the queries.
